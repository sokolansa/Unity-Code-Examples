If you want to use steamworks in your steam game, you will need a steam game on steam.
    It does not have to be published. however there is a big problem, it costs 100$. 
    Thats why there exists a game called "Spacewar", Spacewar can be used for testing achivements.
    You already have Spacewar, theres no need to install anything. 
    However you need to set some stuff up first.
1. you must create a steam manager in your scene.
2. select the steam manager gameobject and find the script "Steam Manager".
Then find the "App Id" element in the inspector and change it to 480.
480 is Spacewar's AppID.

Now you are ready to use steamworks in unity

if you want a player prefab to spawn on game start,
you must locate and assign the your Player Prefab in the "Steam Manager" script.
you will find a "Player Prefab" element in the steam manager script.
drag your prefab in there, and you are good to go
