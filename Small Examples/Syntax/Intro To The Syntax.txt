To be able to use C#, you must understand the syntax. if you don`t know what syntax is, here is a quick explanation of what it is.

"A programming language syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure and grammar of a programming language. 
It dictates how programs written in that language must be constructed, and what the allowable expressions, statements, and commands are."

Now that you are all caught up, lets dig into the C# syntax.

1. Variables: In C#, variables are declared using a type followed by a name, and can be assigned a value using the "=" operator. 
For example, "int x = 5;" declares a variable named "x" of type integer and initializes it with a value of 5.

2. Functions and Methods: C# uses a function and method syntax that is similar to other C-style languages, 
with function and method names followed by a set of parentheses that may include arguments. For example, "void Main()"



Now lets talk about some other stuff

Public: when you create a function, you can make it be avaliable for other scripts
